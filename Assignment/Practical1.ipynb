    "In this Lab I will train first Machine Learning Model. There are multiple algorithms to train the model but here I will apply the `univariate linear regression`, which is a simple yet powerful algorithm that models the `relationship` between one `**independent variable**` and a `**dependent variable**` using a `linear equation: Y = mX + c`. <span style=\"font-size:10px\">Refered from :https://github.com/CSCN8010/CSCN8010/tree/main/class_notebooks/linear_regression</span>\n",
