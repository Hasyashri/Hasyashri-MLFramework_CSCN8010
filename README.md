**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
This project applies Univariate( means only one at a time ) feature for Linear Regression using California Houses Prices Dataset. The goal is to find that which model tell about variations in the median house value at its best. There are 3 features included as below.
•	Median Income
•	Population
•	Number of Households
The model performance evaluated using Mean Square Error(MSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and R^2 score.

**CONCLUSION**
In conclusion, after running and testing the linear regression on three model, the Median House values and Median  Income  best fit for the linear regression and gives the best prediction for the house price.
